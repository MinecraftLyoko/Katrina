# Katrina

Katrina is a tool that will run a Minecraft server on a machine and connect it to a Slack Team to allow users to interact slightly with the game from outside the game.  Java is a prerequisite for this as it is for Minecraft.  You can choose between using Vanilla Minecraft and Craftbukkit.
